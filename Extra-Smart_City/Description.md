# Smart City - Population Prediction
## Problem: Smart City Management System
## Overview:
Develop an integrated system to enhance urban living through efficient resource management, improved public safety, and enhanced citizen engagement. This system will incorporate web and mobile applications, machine learning algorithms, blockchain for security and transparency, and artificial intelligence for data analysis and decision-making.
## Subcomponents:
1. Web Development: Build a responsive web portal for citizens to report issues, access city services, and view real-time data on city operations.
2. Mobile Development: Develop a mobile application for on-the-go access to city services, notifications, and reporting.
3. Machine Learning: Create predictive models to forecast city resource needs and detect anomalies in city operations.
4. Blockchain: Implement a blockchain-based ledger for transparent and secure record-keeping of city transactions and citizen interactions.
5. Artificial Intelligence: Develop AI-driven solutions for optimizing city operations and enhancing citizenÂ engagement.

Title: Population Prediction  
Problem Statement:  
The aim of this project is to develop a robust predictive model that accurately forecasts the population across different wards of Pune City. This prediction will aid Government Agencies and Pune Municipal Corporation in making informed decisions regarding resource allocation, infrastructure development, and service delivery, thereby creating a Smart City.

A smart city is an urban area that uses various types of electronic Internet of Things (IoT) sensors to collect data and then uses these data to manage assets and resources efficiently. This includes data collected from citizens, devices, and assets that is processed and analyzed to monitor and manage traffic and transportation systems, power plants, water supply networks, waste management, law enforcement, information systems, schools, libraries, hospitals, and other community services. The goal is to ensure that these services operate effectively and efficiently, while also improving the quality of life for residents through technology-driven solutions.  

Population prediction is crucial for smart cities due to several reasons:
1. Resource Allocation
2. Urban Planning
3. Infrastructure Management
4. Emergency Preparedness
5. Economic Development
6. Environmental Impact

In essence, population prediction serves as a cornerstone for smart city initiatives by enabling proactive planning and decision-making that enhances livability, sustainability, and resilience in urban environments.
